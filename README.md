## ecoflow-mqtt adapter for ioBroker

connects to ecoflow products

## WARNING

This adapter uses a non-offical communication with the devices. 
Wrong communication or setting wrong values can affect the functionality of the device.


The adapter is based on the work of:
* my own evaluation and research
* https://github.com/tolwi/hassio-ecoflow-cloud
* https://haus-automatisierung.com/hardware/2023/02/13/ecoflow-river-2-usv-batteriespeicher.html
* https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/66743/ecoflow-connector-script-zur-dynamischen-leistungsanpassung
* https://konkludenz.de/en/making-ecoflow-wave2-smart-home-capable-with-node-red-and-mqtt


## Installation and Configuration

Install the adapter from github.

![some mor details](doc/en/installation.md)

In Admin Page (first tab) the mqqt credentials for the mqqt Broker need to be inserted.
* UserName - something like "app-...."
* UserID - a 19 digit number
* UserPassword - an alphanumeric
* ClientID - a string starting with "ANDROID_...."

There are 3 possibilities:
1. by script https://github.com/mmiller7/ecoflow-withoutflow/blob/main/cloud-mqtt/ecoflow_get_mqtt_login.sh
2. by website https://energychain.github.io/site_ecoflow_mqtt_credentials/
3. by adapters own alogorithm (pressing the button), for this the ecoflow username and password is necessary.

The mqqt Broker settings are default and usually need no modification.

Use the tab "Device(s) Configuration" for adding your power equipment.

<details><summary><i> Parametrizing the Powerstream</i></summary>
<p>

* add a new row
* set the deviceID of Powerstream as shown in the app, something like "HW51...."
* give it a name
* select the version (600W or 800W)

</p></details>

<details><summary><i>Parametrizing the Powerstation</i></summary>
<p>

* add a new row
* set the deviceID of Powerstation as shown in the app, string varies by type of device
* give it a name
* select the device type
* if additional battery pack is connected, check the port number where it is connected

</p></details>

<details><summary><i>Parametrizing the Smart Plug</i></summary>
<p>

* add a new row
* set the deviceID of Smart Plug as shown in the app, something like "HW52...."
* give it a name
* set the type to "plug"

</p></details>

Use the tab "Generator / SHP Configuration" for adding your power equipment.

<details><summary><i>Parametrizing the Generator</i></summary>
<p>

* add a new row
* set the deviceID of Generator as shown in the app, something like "DGEB...."
* give it a name
* set the type to "generator"

</p></details>

Use the tab "Wave / Glacier Configuration" for adding your equipment.

<details><summary><i>Parametrizing the Wave</i></summary>
<p>

* add a new row
* set the deviceID of Smart Plug as shown in the app, something like "KT21ZCH..."
* give it a name
* set the type to "plug"

</p></details>

<details><summary><i>Parametrizing the Glacier</i></summary>
<p>

* add a new row
* set the deviceID of Smart Plug as shown in the app, something like "BX11ZCB..."
* give it a name
* set the type to "plug"

</p></details>

Use the tab "Homeassistant" for setup of MQTT connection to HA

<details><summary><i>Parametrizing Homeassistant Connector</i></summary>
<p>

* enable the service
* set the user settings of the MQTT Broker of HA
* set the connection parameter of the MQTT Broker of HA
* select debug settings if required

Modification at HA side:

* The adapter uses the discovery function in HA, no configuration of datapoints in HA is needed.
* MQTT add-on ...

</p></details>

## ioBroker adapter functions 

* the defined devices are connected to the adapter via mqtt
* the adapter filters the incomming messages of the devices. only changed values are stored internally
* if the App prevents adjusting at a certain condition, when known it is replicated (e.g. inverter ON when below minimum battery charge is prevented, you can see a warning in the log )
* not everything is known, so information to status interpretation may be uncertain, this is mostly marked with trailing "?"

### remarks to update of data point setup (min, max, unit, ....)

If settings to a data point are changed in the new version of adapter (e.g. name, unit, max value) the change is not effective until you:
- stop the adapter instance
- delete the respective datapoint or the whole object structure of the adapter instance
- start the adapter instance

During startup the datapoints are created, but not changed when existing.

## HA connector/gateway

* the MQTT discovery function in HA enables an elegant way of information exchange
* at each iobroker adapter start all discovery objects are transmitted to HA (even the should retain in HA)
* iobroker adapter filters the incomming messages of the devices. only changed values are stored internally and transferred to HA.
* if a value is not set by device data update, it will appear as unknown in HA
* if the device is reachable, then the availability will be shown in the device connectivity, this is inherited to the "sub-devices" (unavailability is precessed in the same way)

### annotations to functionality

* Due to to the asynchronity of information updates and command transfer sometimes race conditions may be visible. So a switch is commanded and its toggling back and forth before it stays, can be observed.
* restart of HA may not be recognized correctly in iobroker, so it needs a manual restart of the adapter (WIP)

## Implemented Devices

some explanation to the device data
* number -> data point with numeric value
* level -> adjustable data point with numeric value, sometimes also selections which have numeric representation
* switch -> adjustable data point boolean
* diagnostic -> boolean or multi state data point transferred to text
* string -> datapoint as text only
* array -> datapoint with array
